## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## üèà Usage

### Starting the App

1. Make sure the backend API is running on http://localhost:4000
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173

### Features Overview

#### Player Table

- Sortable columns: Overall Rank, Position Rank, Name, Position, Team, Tier, Auction Value, Yahoo Value
- Click column headers to sort (click again to reverse sort order)

#### Filtering
- **Search**: Type player names to filter results
- **Position Filters**: 
  - Individual positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST)
  - Flex: Shows RB/WR/TE players
  - Superflex: Shows QB/RB/WR/TE players
- **Team Filter**: Dropdown to filter by NFL team

#### Editing Players
- Click on Tier, Auction Value, or Yahoo Value cells to edit
- Changes are tracked and highlighted
- Use "Save Changes" button to commit all edits to the backend
- Use "Clear" button to discard pending changes

#### Pagination

## üé® Design

The frontend features a clean, minimal design with:
- Modern card-based layout
- Color-coded position badges
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Accessible form controls and navigation

## üîß Configuration

### API Endpoint
The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at `http://localhost:4000/api`. To change this, update the `baseURL` in `src/services/api.js`:

```javascript
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://your-backend-url/api',
  // ...
});
```

### Styling
All styles are contained in component-specific CSS files in `src/components/`. The design uses:
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts
- CSS animations for smooth interactions

## üì± Responsive Design

The app is fully responsive and works well on:
- Desktop computers (1200px+)
- Tablets (768px - 1199px)
- Mobile phones (< 768px)

Mobile-specific features:
- Touch-friendly buttons and controls
- Collapsible filter sections
- Optimized table scrolling
- Larger touch targets

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues
- Verify the backend is running on http://localhost:4000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure backend has CORS enabled for frontend origin

### Performance Issues
- Use pagination with smaller page sizes for better performance
- Clear browser cache if experiencing stale data
- Check network tab for slow API requests

### Build Issues
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```
